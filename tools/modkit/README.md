# modkit: shared Skyrim SE build tooling

The build tooling for the Blackshield mod series, written to be reused by every mod in it. Everything runs natively on Linux. No Creation Kit, Wine or Windows needed.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `Modkit.Mutagen/` | C# class library on top of [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen) 0.54 (.NET 9). |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/FormIdRegistry.cs` | Stable FormID allocation from a committed `formids.json`, starting at 0x800 so the plugin stays ESL-safe. |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/Vmad.cs` | Script attachment helpers: object, alias, array, int, float and bool properties. |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/Cond.cs` | Condition helpers (globals, location keyword/ref type, location form lists). |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/PapyrusIndex.cs` + `PluginValidator.cs` | Re-reads a written plugin and checks the ESL range, masters, dangling links, quest alias references, `<Alias=…>`/`<Global=…>` text tags against the quest's aliases and Text Display Globals, message box button counts, and every script property against the `.psc` sources. Properties left unfilled on purpose can be passed as `expectedUnfilled` so real gaps still stand out as warnings. Ends with a byte-exact round trip. Writes a JSON report. |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/TextGlobals.cs` | `TextGlobals.Register(mod)` adds every global named by a `<Global=…>` tag in quest text (name, journal, objectives), player dialogue (topic text, prompts) and message boxes to the owning quest's Text Display Globals. Call it after building records, before writing. `TextGlobals.Check(mod)` (run by the validator) fails on unknown or unregistered globals and on `<Global=…>` in NPC response text, which the engine never expands. |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/SilentVoice.cs` | Silent voice files for unvoiced dialogue: one 16-bit PCM WAV per response at `Sound/Voice/<plugin>/<VoiceType>/<Quest>_<Topic>_<INFO id>_<n>.wav`, sized to the text (words / 2.6 + 1 s, 2-12 s). Refuses quest/topic EditorIDs that the engine would truncate. |
| `Modkit.Mutagen/SeqFile.cs` | Writes `SEQ/<plugin>.seq` (Start Game Enabled quests, on-disk FormIDs with the plugin's own master index), as the Creation Kit / xEdit do. |
| `Modkit.Compat/` | Console tool that loads any number of plugins (from FOMOD zips or loose .esp) together and checks masters/load order, ESL ranges and simulated runtime FormIDs, EditorID and prefix collisions, duplicate script names, overlapping overrides, global clashes, cross-plugin links and installed-file collisions. Writes a Markdown report. `dotnet run --project tools/modkit/Modkit.Compat -- --report compat.md dist/*.zip` |
| `papyrus/build-papyrus.sh` | Compiles `.psc` to `.pex` with the open-source [russo-2025/papyrus-compiler](https://github.com/russo-2025/papyrus-compiler), pinned and checksum-verified. `-H <dir>` type-checks against the game's real sources. `--official <CK dir>` uses Bethesda's PapyrusCompiler.exe through Wine (untested). |
| `papyrus/pex_normalize.py` | Strips the user name, machine name and timestamp from `.pex` headers for reproducible builds. |
| `papyrus-stubs/` | Clean-room declarations of the vanilla Papyrus API subset used so far. These are signatures only, written from the public API docs, not Bethesda's sources. **Add new functions here as later mods need them**, matching the vanilla signature exactly, including default arguments, because the compiler bakes defaults into the call site. |
| `fomod/pack.py` | Validates `ModuleConfig.xml` against `fomod/schema/ModuleConfig.xsd` (GandaG, MIT, one typo fixed) and checks that every source path exists. Writes a deterministic zip. |

## Starting the next mod

1. Copy `tools/modkit/` into the new repo as-is (or extract it into its own repo and add it as a git submodule once a second mod uses it).
2. Copy the shape of `src/plugin/BlackshieldCompany.Generator` (`Program.cs` stays almost identical; records go in a `Builder`), `build.sh`, `fomod/`, and `CHANGELOG.md` (the build reads the version from the first `## [x.y.z]` heading).
3. Use a new EditorID prefix per mod (`BSC_`, `BOO_`, …) and start with an empty `formids.json`.
4. Keep the copies of `tools/modkit/` in sync between repos when you change it.

## Changelog

- **War Banners (mod 8):** `Vmad.AliasList` fills a `ReferenceAlias[]` property (here: another quest's aliases). The validator checks every alias property, single or array, against the aliases of the quest it names. Stubs: `Activator`, `Math.Sin`/`Cos`, `Spell.Cast`, `ObjectReference.GetAngleZ`/`SetAngle`/`SetScale`/`AddInventoryEventFilter`/`OnItemAdded`, `ReferenceAlias.AddInventoryEventFilter`/`OnItemAdded`, `Actor.IsOnMount`, `Utility.GetCurrentRealTime`.

- **Blackshield Codex (mod 7):** plugins with other mods as masters. `PluginValidator.Validate` takes the master files (`masterPlugins`) and resolves every link into them by FormID and record type; the round trip keeps the header's master order. `build-papyrus.sh -I <dir>` adds import directories on top of the stubs, so a script can call another mod's scripts (type-checked, not compiled). Write plugins with masters in a fixed order with `WithNoLoadOrder().WithMastersListOrdering(...)`.

- **The Gray-Mane Debt (mod 6):** dialogue support. `Vmad.InfoFragment` binds TopicInfo fragment scripts; `Cond` gained `IsID`, `IsAliasRef`, `Stage`, `QuestRunning`, `ItemCount`, `MakeVsGlobal` (compare against a global) and `OnRef` (run on a reference such as the player). `PapyrusIndex` records function signatures. The validator now checks dialogue: fragment file attached, fragment function declared with a single `ObjectReference` parameter, TopicInfo base type, topics in a branch, branch/topic quest agreement, response numbering, 149-character response limit, linked topics in the same quest, a voice file for every response, and the SEQ file against the Start Game Enabled quests. New `SilentVoice`, `SeqFile` and the `Modkit.Compat` cross-mod checker. Stubs: `TopicInfo`, `ReferenceAlias.OnRead`/`OnContainerChanged`/`OnActivate`, `ObjectReference.OnContainerChanged`, `Actor.SetActorValue`, `Faction.SetEnemy`/`SetAlly`, `Game.IncrementSkill`.
- **Contract Hunter, Steel Oath, Ember Smithing (mods 3-5):** validator checks each attached script's `extends` chain against the record type (Quest, ActiveMagicEffect, ReferenceAlias/LocationAlias for alias scripts, ObjectReference for items). Stubs for spells, scrolls, races, equipped-item queries and `OnSpellCast`.

- **Bounties of Oblivion (mod 2):** validator checks quest text tags, message button counts and an expected-unfilled list. Stubs gained `Form.RegisterForSleep`/`UnregisterForSleep`, `OnSleepStart`/`OnSleepStop`, `Quest.UpdateCurrentInstanceGlobal` and `Potion`. Removed `Form.GetName`, which is an SKSE addition and must not be used by mods that promise "no SKSE". Generators set `QuestFormVersion = 65` (what the SE Creation Kit writes; Mutagen's default is 255).
- **Blackshield Company (mod 1):** initial version.

## Notes

- Mutagen writes the plugin with `WithNoLoadOrder()`. Only reference masters you list in the validator's allowed set (Skyrim.esm here).
- Vanilla FormIDs were looked up with the `Mutagen.Bethesda.FormKeys.SkyrimSE` NuGet package. Mesh paths and record shapes were checked against public Spriggit exports of vanilla records. No Skyrim.esm was needed on the build machine.
- To check the stubs against real headers on a machine with the game installed: unpack `Data/Scripts.zip` and run `./build.sh -H "<Skyrim>/Data/Source/Scripts"`.
